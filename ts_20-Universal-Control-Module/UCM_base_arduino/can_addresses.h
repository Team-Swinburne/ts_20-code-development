    INTRO
    Team Swinburne devices shall make use of a standard format for increasing 
    the readability of the CAN. Note that this is not a networking stack, nor
    the framework for a networking stack, but rather a simple oranisation of
    the vehicle's data link layer for ease of interpretation. 

    The TS_22 vehicle shall included one global CANBUS, and two CANBUS dedicated to a link between 
    the throttle controller and inverters.

DEVICE ADDRESS SPACE

Each device that is designed by the team will have a three byte long base address.
The first of these bytes is used to signify the high level priority of the 
device in relation to the vehicle. Devices, such as the BMS, Brake, and throttle,
will be assigned the lowest address, as these will take precedence during the 
CANBUS arbiration phase.
The second byte signifies the version of the device. This is intended to future
proof boards, and provide space for 15 additional devices where multiple may be 
required. Should more address space be required for additional devices, this can 
be subdivided.
The thrid byte is the message code, an address space that is directly related 
to the device.

MESSAGE CODE STRUCTURE

The first six message codes are assigned to specific device outputs and should be taken
into consideration when designing the devices output. 
    Heartbeat: This is used to reflect the devices status and should iterate once per second,
        counting the time since the last reset event. This serves as a simple debugging tool
        and allows for watchdogs to be attached between devices with ease.
    
    Errors/Warnings: The first 4 bytes are for semiphores relating to the health of the device, 
        errors being flags that should stop the vehicle, and warnings being those that should 
        be relayed to the driver. These codes should use bitwise logic to maximise the information.
        To assist in human readability, the highest prority messages should be assigned to the final 
        four bytes of the message, since these will be easier to read in hexidecimal format.
    
    Digital 1 & 2: A space for 16 bytes of potential semiphores. These can be broken up into 128 bits,
        if required.
    
    Analogue 1 & 2: A space for 16 bytes worth of analogue values. These can be combined into pairs for
        16 bit resolution. Note that unsigned, and big endian is the preferred 16 bit method due to 
        readability concerns, however both are acceptable, provided the database is updated. 

For the sake of simplicity, these can be left as 8 byte messages, however once an order is sorted,
care should be taken to reduce the byte count and increase network throughput.

The message code structures are broken down as follows:

M.ID    Message Name        Byte 0          Byte 1          Byte 2              Byte 3          Byte 4          Byte 5          Byte 6          Byte 7
0.      Heartbeat           State           Counter         PCB Temperature     Compiled Date
1.      Errors/Warnings     Error[0]        Error[1]        Warning[0]          Warning[1]      SPARE_1         SPARE_2         SPARE_3         SPARE_4
2.      Digital 1           Digital[0]      Digital[1]      Digital[2]          Digital[3]      Digital[4]      Digital[5]      Digital[6]      Digital[7]

4.      Analogue 1          Analogue[0]     Analogue[1]     Analogue[2]         Analogue[3]     Analogue[4]     Analogue[5]     Analogue[6]     Analogue[7]

MESSAGE TIMINGS

Care must be taken to avoid overloaded the network, and decreasing the amount of jitter
that may be experienced by nodes. The following should serve as a guide for recommended 
message periods that will provided an acceptable amount of network traffic, whilst 
still relaying infomation about the vehicle. Care should always be taken to ensure 
that each signal is being sampled at a the nyquest frequency. Some additional tricks may need
to be used to increase the potential sampling frequencies, such as packing in a time-multiplexed
signal into a single frame.

Message Description                                 Minimum Period (ms)
Heartbeats                                          1000
Error/Warning (Information Only)                    500
Error/Warning (Safety Critical/Watchdog Required)   100
Digital/Analogue (Driver Reaction Times)            10
Digital/Analogue (High Nyquest speeds required)     50
Digital/Analogue (Medium frequency acceptable)      200
Digital/Analogue (Low Priority)                     500
